# Why 88 days?

Completing **88 calendar days** of “specified regional work” lets Working-Holiday makers (subclass 417 or 462) apply for a **2nd-year visa**. A further 6 months (179 days) unlocks a 3rd year.

## 4. How to log your 88 days

1. **Calendar days, not hours.** Any day you work at least 1 shift counts as one calendar day.  
2. **Full-time weeks**: 5 consecutive 8-hour days = 7 calendar days (yes, weekends count).  
3. **Part-time or piece-rate**: keep payslips showing each day you clocked in.  
4. **Form 1263**: have each employer sign Section 5 before you leave the farm.  
5. **Digital records**: scan payslips & timesheets to cloud storage in case paper copies fade.

---

## 5. Minimum pay & conditions

- **Hourly award**: most farm roles fall under the **Horticulture Award** ($24.10 p/h + super, July 2025).  
- **Piece rates**: legal only if a written agreement guarantees the award minimum *averaged* over hours worked.  
- **Tax**: backpackers pay 15% on the first \$45 000 (if they’ve supplied a TFN).  
- **Superannuation**: 11% on top of wages; claim it back when leaving Australia (Departing Australia Super Payment).

## 6. Avoiding common pitfalls

| Pitfall | How to avoid it |
|---------|-----------------|
| Cash-in-hand offers | Ask for payslips; no payslip = no evidence for Home Affairs. |
| Fake postcode | Cross-check on the Home Affairs list before starting. |
| Underpayment | Know the award rate; piece rate must still meet it. |
| Missing records | Photograph payslips weekly; back up to Google Drive/Dropbox. |

## 7. Ready to apply for your 2nd-year visa?

1. Log in to **immi.account** ➜ **New Application** ➜ *“Working Holiday (Extension)”*.  
2. Upload passport, **Form 1263**, payslips, bank statements.  
3. Pay the current visa fee (AUD 635 as of July 2025).  
4. Wait for the grant email (typical processing 2–6 weeks).
