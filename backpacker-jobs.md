## Why work while backpacking?

Earning as you travel stretches your budget and lets you stay on the road longer. Typical roles include:

* **Farm & fruit-picking** – Seasonal harvest gigs in QLD & NSW.
* **Hospitality** – Barista, server and bar roles in tourist hubs.
* **Hostel work-for-accommodation** – Exchange a few hours’ cleaning or reception for a free bed.
* **Construction & labouring** – Good pay, white-card required.

### How to land a job quickly

1. **Get an Australian TFN** before you apply so employers can pay you legally.  
2. **Update your resume** with an Australian phone number and address (hostel is fine).  
3. **Join Facebook groups** like “Backpacker Jobs Brisbane” and “Fruit Picking Australia”.  
4. **Use platforms** such as Seek, Jobaroo and Backpacker Job Board.  
5. **Walk-ins still work**—print ten CVs and hand them to cafés early in the morning.
